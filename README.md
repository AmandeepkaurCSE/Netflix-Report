### Insights
The top three genres on which investments for upcoming movies should be focused are Dramas, International Movies, and Stand-Up Comedy. These genres have shown a higher viewership and popularity among the audience. Therefore, allocating resources and producing content in these genres is likely to attract a significant number of viewers and increase engagement on the platform. 

The majority of viewers show a preference for watching movies, likely due to the shorter time commitment required compared to TV shows. Movies offer a more concise viewing experience, while TV shows can extend for weeks to months, and viewers may prefer to avoid dedicating extended periods of time to watching them.
