### Insights
The optimal strategy for directing investments towards upcoming movies revolves around prioritizing three genres: Dramas, International Movies, and Stand-Up Comedy. These genres have consistently garnered substantial viewership and immense popularity among the audience. Consequently, channeling resources and content creation efforts into these genres is poised to attract a substantial viewership and enhance engagement on the platform.

A predominant inclination among viewers is evident towards movies as their preferred choice. This preference can be attributed to the relatively shorter time commitment required in contrast to TV shows. Movies offer a more succinct and compact viewing experience, a departure from TV shows that may extend over weeks or even months. Viewers often seek to evade prolonged time investments when it comes to entertainment, thus enhancing the allure of movies over TV shows.
